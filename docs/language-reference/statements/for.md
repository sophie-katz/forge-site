# For loops

```
for i in range {
	// ...
}
```

## Details

For loops iterate over an iterable object, such as a range, array, or string. The loop variable (`i` in the above example) is assigned the value of each element in the iterable object in turn.

There are slightly different syntaxes for iterating over different types of values.
